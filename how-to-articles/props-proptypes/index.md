# Props & Prop-Types
First create a child component to the Foo component we created [previously].

_[/src/components/Foo/greeting.js]_
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <strong>Hello, {this.props.name}!</strong>
    );
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```

Import the Greeting component to the Foo component:  
```javascript
import Greeting from './greeting';
```

Render the Greeting component in the Foo component, passing in your name as a property.    
_remember you need to wrap multiple JSX elements in a react fragment or a wrapper div_    
```jsx
<Greeting name="Joe Bloggs" />
```

See the [REACT docs] for why prop types are used:   

> As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application. But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities.

PWA Studio uses prop types in the following way. Import the propTypes library to the Greeting component:   
```javascript
import { PropTypes, string } from 'prop-types';
```

Add type checking with a static property within the Greeting component after the opening brace:
```javascript
class Greeting extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string
  };
  // other code...
}
```

Try passing in an invalid prop type to the Greeting component. And check your browser console for any errors.    
i.e. `<Greeting name={2} />`
